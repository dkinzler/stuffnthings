Next steps
* generally
    * design for the default case of how you will use it
    * add a bit of comment for decision decisions
* After Github clean everything up before you add more stuff -> go file by file and fix stuff
* github
    * on repos cloned screen we use esc to return instead of maybe enter to continue? whatever?
        * but we also don't handle confirmQuit right then, because the esc from reposCloned is caught by the outermodel to confirm exit
        * or is that fine that we confirm the quit again? why not
    * do we need to run something special to get complete "git history" when cloning? or do we always get everything?
    * otherwise it seems fine
* make styles a global var? would be easier don't have to pass stuff around
* should we have a global config dir that includes backupdir as well?
* full TUI is fine and looks great, but for usability something even simpler would have probably worked better?
    * where we just have a config file and if there is e.g. a github token set then it will backup all github repos, automatically
    * so that from the config file almost everything happens automatically maybe it shows a few options and stuff on the cli, but not in full screen?
    * i mean could experiment with that later, whatever we have now is also fine, finish it
    * can then later think about it again, maybe add a non-interactive mode that does exactly that or not, whatever
* we should maybe put config in a seperate package, that way we can pass the structs like github to the inner models, or just the complete config?
    * or maybe even better the inner components should define their own config struct and can then combine it into the global one in ui.go -> yes, that's the right way
* red text for error messages?
    * prolly not
* in general we need to standardize things across the models so it feels the same
    * e.g. keys for continue, quit etc.
    * text the same etc.
* error pages
    * instead of showing detailed errors can also just give the bare minimum and refer to logs, that is probably easier because usually things shouldn't go wrong
        * especially when commands go wrong -> think about it again
    * make that "ups, something went wrong"
    * just distribute available space between stdout and stderr equaly if non are empty
    * create a command error page similar to the ex we have right now
        * show command that was run and output of stdout and stderr + exit code and error if running it failed
        * need to put a bit of effort into making it look nice
            * can we set hieight of view dynamicylla based on content e.g. max 10 lines but if it is smaller we show less
        * look at viewport example again to add the border and progress indicator and co
* help
    * check again if we did this everyhwere
    * for many we can just have fixed short or full help, because even full help is just like 2 lines
    * don't need to implement full/short help functions and can just use helpView.ShortHelpView etc.
    * also need to set width on help -> we can yes? everywhere, every model a SetSize function that does this
* for dialogs
    * can also have some functions that combine stuff e.g. a view or render function that takes title, content and keymap and applies common formatting
    * remove dialog.go
* for command error page we could instead
    * show the last lines of output and error streams
    * and have keys to open the full things in less or more?
    * that would work well
    * need to handle all the keys again, but that is fine, shouldn't be too much work
* zip works but still some todos to make it look nicer and fix the small bugs and things and make code a bit better
    * better error output, maybe include complete output in a view?
* think about dir selection again if it is the right workflow or we missed any sanity checks or similar?
* pretty
	* did anything change in the lipgloss package?
    * do we do top level padding/margin or each model gets the full screen?
    * dir selection from top to bottom
* what about testing?
* update readme
    * note that menu.go contains comment on how to add a new component
* how to do a "progress report"
	* e.g. if you run a command like an external program that runs some time and u want to emit multiple messages from there?
		* is there an example for this? or somebody probably asked this before -> google
